Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of historical data on used car sales. It includes various features such as car make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and more. The data has been carefully curated and anonymized to protect privacy while ensuring data quality.

Model
Features
Car Pred uses a comprehensive set of features to make accurate price predictions for used cars. Some of the key features considered in the model are:

Car make and model
Year of manufacture
Kilometers driven (mileage)
Fuel type (petrol, diesel, CNG, electric, etc.)
Transmission type (automatic or manual)
Number of previous owners
Car condition
and more...
Data Preprocessing
Before training the model, the dataset undergoes thorough data preprocessing. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and addressing outliers to ensure the data is suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Model Selection
We have carefully evaluated various machine learning models, including regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression, along with neural networks. Based on extensive testing and evaluation, we have selected the best-performing model to ensure accurate and reliable predictions.

Model Training
The selected model is trained on a substantial portion of the dataset using supervised learning techniques. We employ a train-test split to assess the model's performance and fine-tune its hyperparameters to achieve optimal predictive capabilities.

Usage
To use Car Pred and obtain price predictions for a used car, you can utilize the provided Python script predict.py. The script allows you to input various car attributes and returns the predicted price. Detailed instructions on how to use the script can be found in the README.md file within the repository.

Contributing
We encourage and appreciate contributions from the community to enhance and expand Car Pred. Whether it's feature enhancements, bug fixes, or other improvements, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests. Let's collaborate to make Car Pred an even better tool!
